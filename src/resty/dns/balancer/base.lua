--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Base-balancer.
--
-- The base class for balancers. It implements DNS resolution and fanning
-- out hostnames to addresses. It builds and maintains a tree structure:
--
--   `balancer <1 --- many> hosts <1 --- many> addresses`
--
-- Updating the DNS records is active, meaning that a background task is running
-- to periodically update DNS records when they expire. This only applies to the
-- hostnames added to the balancer, not to any nested DNS records.
--
-- __Weights__
--
-- Weights will be tracked as follows. Since a Balancer has multiple Hosts, and
-- a Host has multiple Addresses. The Host weight will be the sum of all its
-- addresses, and the Balancer weight will be the sum of all Hosts.
-- See `addHost` on how to set the weight for an `address`.
--
-- The weight of each `address` will be the weight provided as `nodeWeight` when adding
-- a `host`. So adding a `host` with weight 20, that resolves to 2 IP addresses, will
-- insert 2 `addresses` each with a weight of 20, totalling the weight of the `host` to
-- 40.
--
-- Exception 1: If the `host` resolves to an SRV record, in which case each
-- `address` gets the weight as specified in the DNS record. In this case the
-- `nodeWeight` property will be ignored.
--
-- Exception 2: If the DNS record for the `host` has a `ttl=0` then the record contents
-- will be ignored, and a single address with the original hostname will be
-- inserted. This address will get a weight assigned of `nodeWeight`.
-- Whenever the balancer hits this address, it will be resolved on the spot, hence
-- honouring the `ttl=0` value.
--
-- __Adding and resolving hosts__
--
-- When adding a host, it will be resolved and for each entry an `address` will be
-- added. With the exception of a `ttl=0` setting as noted above. When resolving the
-- names, any CNAME records will be dereferenced immediately, any other records
-- will not.
--
-- _Example 1: add an IP address "127.0.0.1"_
--
-- The host object will resolve the name, and since it's and IP address it
-- returns a single A record with 1 entry, that same IP address.
--
--    host object 1   : hostname="127.0.0.1"  --> since this is the name added
--    address object 1: ip="127.0.0.1"        --> single IP address
--
-- _Example 2: complex DNS lookup chain_
--
-- assuming the following lookup chain for a `host` added by name `"myhost"`:
--
--    myhost    --> CNAME yourhost
--    yourhost  --> CNAME herhost
--    herhost   --> CNAME theirhost
--    theirhost --> SRV with 2 entries: host1.com, host2.com
--    host1.com --> A with 1 entry: 192.168.1.10
--    host2.com --> A with 1 entry: 192.168.1.11
--
-- Adding a host by name `myhost` will first create a `host` by name `myhost`. It will then
-- resolve the name `myhost`, the CNAME chain will be dereferenced immediately, so the
-- result will be an SRV record with 2 named entries. The names will be used for the
-- addresses:
--
--    host object 1   : hostname="myhost"
--    address object 1: ip="host1.com"  --> NOT an ip, but a name!
--    address object 2: ip="host2.com"  --> NOT an ip, but a name!
--
-- When the balancer hits these addresses (when calling `getPeer`), it will
-- dereference them (so they will be resolved at balancer-runtime, not at
-- balancer-buildtime).
--
-- There is another special case, in case a record has a ttl=0 setting. In that case
-- a "fake" SRV record is inserted, to make sure we honour the ttl=0 and resolve
-- on each `getPeer` invocation, without altering the balancer every time.
-- Here's an example:
--
--    myhost    --> A with 1 entry: 192.168.1.10, and TTL=0
--
-- Internally it is converted into a fake SRV record which results in the following
-- balancer structure:
--
--    host object 1   : hostname="myhost"
--    address object 1: ip="myhost"  --> NOT an ip, but a name!
--
-- This in turn will result in DNS resolution on each call for an IP, and hence will
-- make sure the ttl=0 setting is effectively being used.
--
-- __Handle management__
--
-- handles are used to retain state between consecutive invocations (calls to
-- the `objBalancer:getPeer` method). The handles are re-used and tracked for
-- garbage collection. There are two uses:
--
--  1. tracking progress (eg. keeping a retry count)
--  2. tracking resources (eg. with least connections a handle 'owns' 1
--  connection, to be released when the connection is finished)
--
-- The basic flow and related responsibilities:
--
--  - user code calls `getPeer` to get an ip/port/hostname according to the load
--  balancing algorithm.
--  - `getPeer` both takes a handle (on a retry), and returns it (on success).
--  - handles are managed by the base balancer, and `getPeer` can call
--  `objBalancer:getHandle` to get one.
--  - on a retry `getPeer` should call `objAddress:release(handle, ignore)` to release
--  the previous (failed) try, and it should clear the `handle.address` field.
--  - on success `getPeer` should set `handle.address` with the address object that
--  returned the ip, port, and hostname, and return the handle with those.
--  - at the end of the connection life cycle the user code should call
--  `handle:release` to release the resources, and/or collect necessary
--  statistics.
--  - as a safety check the handles will have a GC method attached. So in case
--  they are not explicitly released the (default) GC handler will call
--  `handle.address:release(handle, true)` to make sure no resources leak.
--
--
-- __Clustering__
--
-- The base-balancer is deterministic in the way it adds/removes elements. So
-- as long as the confguration is the same, and adding/removing hosts is done
-- in the same order the exact same balancer will be created. This is important
-- in case of consistent-hashing approaches, since each cluster member needs to
-- behave the same.
--
-- _NOTE_: there is one caveat, DNS resolution is not deterministic, because timing
-- differences might cause different orders of adding/removing. Hence the structures
-- can potentially slowly diverge. If this is unacceptable, make sure you do not
-- invlove DNS by adding hosts by their IP adresses instead of their hostname.
--
-- __Housekeeping__
--
-- The balancer does some house keeping and may insert
-- some extra fields in dns records. Those fields will have an `__` prefix
-- (double underscores).

--- Sets an event callback for user code. The callback is invoked for
-- every address added to/removed from the balancer, and on health changes.
--
-- Signature of the callback is for address adding/removing:
--
--   `function(balancer, "added"/"removed", address, ip, port, hostname, hostheader)`
--
-- - `address` is the address object added
-- - `ip` is the IP address for this object, but might also be a hostname if
--   the DNS resolution returns another name (usually in SRV records)
-- - `port` is the port to use
-- - `hostname` is the hostname for which the address was added to the balancer
--   with `addHost` (resolving that name caused the creation of this address)
-- - `hostheader` is the hostheader to be used. This can have 3 values; 1) `nil` if the
--   `hostname` added was an ip-address to begin with, 2) it will be equal to the
--   name in `ip` if there is a named SRV entry, and `useSRVname == true`, 3) otherwise
--   it will be equal to `hostname`
--
-- For health updates the signature is:
--
--   `function(balancer, "health", isHealthy)`
--
-- NOTE: the callback will be executed async (on a timer) so maybe executed
-- only after the methods (`addHost` and `removeHost` for example) have returned.
-- @param callback a function called when an address is added/removed
-- @return `true`, or throws an error on bad input
-- @within User properties

-- can be reused.

-- 2. _the GC handler_, which is a fallback in case the handle wasn't released
-- by user code. It will be called as `gc_handler(handle)` and the default
-- implementation will call `handle.address:release(handle, true)`.
--
-- @param gc_handler (optional) a custom GC method for when the handle is
-- not explicitly released.
-- @param release_handler (optional) a custom release method to release the
-- resources when the request cycle is complete.

--- Creates a new base balancer.
--
-- A single balancer can hold multiple hosts. A host can be an ip address or a
-- name. As such each host can have multiple addresses (or actual ip+port
-- combinations).
--
-- The options table has the following fields;
--
-- - `dns` (required) a configured `dns.client` object for querying the dns server.
-- - `requery` (optional) interval of requerying the dns server for previously
-- failed queries. Defaults to 30 if omitted (in seconds)
-- - `ttl0` (optional) Maximum lifetime for records inserted with `ttl=0`, to verify
-- the ttl is still 0. Defaults to 60 if omitted (in seconds)
-- - `callback` (optional) a function called when an address is added/changed. See
-- `setCallback` for details.
-- - `log_prefix` (optional) a name used in the prefix for log messages. Defaults to
-- `"balancer"` which results in log prefix `"[balancer 1]"` (the number is a sequential
-- id number)
-- - `healthThreshold` (optional) minimum percentage of the balancer weight that must
-- be healthy/available for the whole balancer to be considered healthy. Defaults
-- to 0% if omitted.
-- - `useSRVname` (optional) if truthy, then in case of the hostname resolving to
-- an SRV record with another level of names, the returned hostname by `getPeer` will
-- not be the name of the host as added, but the name of the entry in the SRV
-- record.
