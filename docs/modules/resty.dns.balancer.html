<h1>Module <code>resty.dns.balancer</code></h1>
<p>Ring-balancer.</p>
<p> This loadbalancer is designed for consistent hashing approaches and
 to retain consistency on a maximum level while dealing with dynamic
 changes like adding/removing hosts/targets.</p>

<p> Due to its deterministic way of operating it is also capable of running
 identical balancers (identical consistent rings) on multiple servers/workers
 (though it does not implement inter-server/worker communication).</p>

<p> Only dns is non-deterministic as it might occur when a peer is requested,
 and hence should be avoided (by directly inserting ip addresses).
 Adding/deleting hosts, etc (as long as done in the same order) is always
 deterministic.</p>

<p> Updating the dns records is passive, meaning that when <a href="../modules/resty.dns.balancer.html#getPeer">getPeer</a> accesses a
 target, only then the check is done whether the record is stale, and if so
 it is updated. The one exception is the failed dns queries (because they
 have no slots assigned, and hence will never be hit by <a href="../modules/resty.dns.balancer.html#getPeer">getPeer</a>), which will
 be actively refreshed using a timer. </p>

<p> Whenever dns resolution fails for a hostname, the host will relinguish all
 the slots it owns, and they will be reassigned to other targets.
 Periodically the query for the hostname will be retried, and if it succeeds
 it will get slots reassigned to it.</p>

<p> <strong>Housekeeping</strong>; the ring-balancer does some house keeping and may insert
 some extra fields in dns records. Those fields will, similar to the <code>toip</code>
 function, have an <code>__</code> prefix (double underscores).</p>

    <dl class="function">
    <dt>
    <a name = "addHost"></a>
    <strong>addHost (hostname, port, weight)</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Adds a host to the balancer.  If the name resolves to multiple entries,
 each entry will be added, all with the same weight. So adding an A record
 with 2 entries, with weight 10, will insert both entries with weight 10,
 and increase to overall balancer weight by 20. The one exception is that if
 it resolves to a record with <code>ttl=0</code>, then it will <strong>always</strong> only insert a single
 (unresolved) entry. The unresolved entry will be resolved by <a href="../modules/resty.dns.balancer.html#getPeer">getPeer</a> when
 requested.</p>

<p> Resolving will be done by the dns clients <code>resolve</code> method. Which will
 dereference CNAME record if set to, but it will not dereference SRV records.
 An unresolved SRV <code>target</code> field will also be resolved by <a href="../modules/resty.dns.balancer.html#getPeer">getPeer</a> when requested.</p>

<p> Only the slots assigned to the newly added targets will loose their
 consistency, all other slots are guaranteed to remain the same.</p>

<p> Within a balancer the combination of <code>hostname</code> and <code>port</code> must be unique, so
 multiple calls with the same target will only update the <code>weight</code> of the
 existing entry.</p>

<p> <strong>multi-server/worker consistency</strong>; to keep multiple servers/workers consistent it is
 important to apply all modifications to the ring-balancer in the exact same
 order on each system. Also the initial <code>order</code> list must be the same. And; do
 not use names, only ip adresses, as dns resolution is non-deterministic
 across servers/workers.


    <h3>Parameters:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="parameter">hostname</span>
         hostname to add (note: not validated, as long as it's a
 string it will be accepted, but remain unresolved!)
        </li>
        <li><span class="parameter">port</span>
         (optional) the port to use (defaults to 80 if omitted)
        </li>
        <li><span class="parameter">weight</span>
         (optional) relative weight for A/AAAA records (defaults to
 10 if omitted), and will be ignored in case of an SRV record.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Returns:</h3>
    <ol>

        balancer object, or throw an error on bad input
    </ol>




</dd>
    <dt>
    <a name = "getPeer"></a>
    <strong>getPeer (hashValue, cacheOnly)</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Gets the next ip address and port according to the loadbalancing scheme.
 If the dns record attached to the requested slot is expired, then it will
 be renewed and as a consequence the ring-balancer might be updated.</p>

<p> If the slot that is requested holds either an unresolved SRV entry (where
 the <code>target</code> field contains a name instead of an ip), or a record with <code>ttl=0</code> then
 this call will perform the final query to resolve to an ip using the <code>toip</code>
 function of the dns client (this also invokes the loadbalancing as done by
 the <code>toip</code> function).


    <h3>Parameters:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="parameter">hashValue</span>
         (optional) number for consistent hashing, round-robins if
 omitted. The hashValue can be an integer from 1 to <code>wheelSize</code>, or a float
 from 0 up to, but not including, 1.
        </li>
        <li><span class="parameter">cacheOnly</span>
         If truthy, no dns lookups will be done, only cache.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Returns:</h3>
    <ol>

        <code>ip + port + hostname</code>, or <code>nil+error</code>
    </ol>




</dd>
    <dt>
    <a name = "new"></a>
    <strong>new (opts)</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>

<p>Creates a new balancer.  The balancer is based on a wheel with slots. The
 slots will be randomly distributed over the targets. The number of slots
 assigned will be relative to the weight.</p>

<p> A single balancer can hold multiple hosts. A host can be an ip address or a
 name. As such each host can have multiple targets (or actual ip+port
 combinations).</p>

<p> The options table has the following fields;</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>hosts</code> (optional) containing hostnames, ports and weights. If omitted,
    ports and weights default respectively to 80 and 10. The list will be sorted
    before being added, so the order of entry is deterministic.</li>
    <li><code>wheelSize</code> (optional) for total number of slots in the balancer, if omitted
    the size of <code>order</code> is used, or 1000 if <code>order</code> is not provided. It is important
    to have enough slots to keep the ring properly randomly distributed. If there
    are to few slots for the number of targets then the load distribution might
    become to coarse. Consider the maximum number of targets expected, as new
    hosts can be dynamically added, and dns renewals might yield larger record
    sets. The <code>wheelSize</code> cannot be altered, only a new wheel can be created, but
    then all consistency would be lost. On a similar note; making it too big,
    will have a performance impact when the wheel is modified as too many slots
    will have to be moved between targets. A value of 50 to 200 slots per entry
    seems about right.</li>
    <li><code>order</code> (optional) if given, a list of random numbers, size <code>wheelSize</code>, used to
    randomize the wheel. This entry is solely to support multiple servers with
    the same consistency, as it allows to use the same randomization on each
    server, and hence the same slot assignment. Duplicates are not allowed in
    the list.</li>
    <li><code>dns</code> (required) a configured <a href="../modules/resty.dns.client.html">dns.client</a> object for querying the dns server.</li>
    <li><code>requery</code> (optional) interval of requerying the dns server for previously
    failed queries. Defaults to 1 if omitted (in seconds)</li>
    <li><code>ttl0</code> (optional) Maximum lifetime for records inserted with ttl=0, to verify
    the ttl is still 0. Defaults to 60 if omitted (in seconds)</li>
</ul>



    <h3>Parameters:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="parameter">opts</span>
         table with options
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Returns:</h3>
    <ol>

        new balancer object or nil+error
    </ol>



    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <ul>

    <dt>
    <a name = "removeHost"></a>
    <strong>removeHost (hostname, port)</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
    Removes a host from a balancer.  All assigned slots will be redistributed
 to the remaining targets. Only the slots from the removed host will loose
 their consistency, all other slots are guaranteed to remain in place.
 Will not throw an error if the hostname is not in the current list.</p>

<p> See <a href="../modules/resty.dns.balancer.html#addHost">addHost</a> for multi-server consistency.

         port to remove (optional, defaults to 80 if omitted)
        </li>
    </ul>
